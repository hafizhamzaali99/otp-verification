## OTP Verification
This project is a simple OTP verification screen built with React.js. It includes a 6-digit OTP input, a timer for resending the OTP, and two buttons for verifying the entered OTP and resending the OTP. The design is clean and minimal, with a focus on ease of use and visual clarity.

This project consists of two main components: the client and the server. You can find the respective README files for more detailed information on each component:
